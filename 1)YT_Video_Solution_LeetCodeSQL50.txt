💡 What Is LeetCode SQL50?

LeetCode SQL50 is a curated list of 50 SQL questions, divided into different learning domains that cover everything from beginner to advanced concepts.
In this series, we’ll tackle each domain systematically so you can progress in a structured way and strengthen your SQL foundation.

🧭 The SQL Roadmap — 7 Domains, 50 Questions
To make learning organized and simple, all 50 questions are grouped into seven main domains:

SELECT Basics — Learn to retrieve and filter data.
Basic JOINS — Understand how to connect multiple tables.
Aggregate Functions — Practice using COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MAX(), MIN().
Sorting and Grouping — Master ORDER BY, GROUP BY, and HAVING.
Advanced SELECT & JOINS — Dive into conditional joins and filtering logic.
Subqueries — Learn how to nest queries effectively.
Advanced String Functions & Regular Expressions — Explore pattern matching and string manipulation.

We’ll go in order — starting with the SELECT domain (which includes 6 questions) and moving forward step by step until we’ve completed all 50.
